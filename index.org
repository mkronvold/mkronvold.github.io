**** Cleanup of unused TKCs
    + 3 more scheduled to remove, waiting on confirmation
**** Cloudy/JIRA

    + Scheduling call to get all the requirements defined ahead of time
    + will need some backing of both DCOps and R&D for this to work
**** OCVS load balancer
    + AVI
      + This will probably require several detailed sessions with vmware
        - possibly a full workshop
      + self-healing software-defined elastic application delivery fabric
        - that just so happens to provide very nice load balancing features
        - also provides WAF, appalytics
        - solves ip pool issues
**** Netapp Cloud Insights
    + Suggest we have Joel work with Adam on setup and implementation
    + Tim, HY, Joel, You and I should brainstorm a list of what we want to get out of it.
      - fancy notetaking, mind mapping

      - No issues observes fo far.
      - Can take a while to show symptoms
      - also includes some critical security fixes
    + Fix Scheduled for staging this weekend
      - More non-prod locations the better I feel about prod
    + Prod will be scheduled for next CI window
      - couple months?
